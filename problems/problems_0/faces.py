# implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input
# and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face)
# and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face).
# All other text should be returned unchanged.

# Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input,
# calls convert on that input, and prints the result.
# You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
# Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.
