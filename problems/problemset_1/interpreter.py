#implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression
# and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. 
# Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z,
# wherein:
# x is an integer
# y is +, -, *, or /
# z is an integer

expression = input("Input your arithmetic expression: ")

x, y, z = expression.split(" ")
x = int(x)
z = int(z)

match y:
    case "+":
        result = float(x + z)
    case "-":
        result = float(x - z)
    case "*":
        result = float(x * z)
    case "/":
        result = float(x / z)

print("{:.1f}".format(result))
